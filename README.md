# The Game

An attempt at creating a multiplayer game using [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket). The server is built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and the client with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## TODO

* Explode pieces. Includes detecting when four (or more) puyos of the same color are connected.
* Notice when there's no room left for spawning of new pieces and transition into a game over state.
